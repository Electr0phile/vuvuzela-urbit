# vuvuzela-urbit
[Vuvuzela messenger](https://github.com/vuvuzela/vuvuzela) implementation on [Urbit](https://urbit.org/).

This is my first attempt in programming on Urbit, so for now it is kind of a mess :)

Plan:
0. ~~Ships can exchange end-to-end encrypted messages
through one server.~~
1. ~~Dead drop logic with just one server.~~
2. ~~Round logic with just one server.~~
    1. ~~Manual round logic.~~
    2. ~~Timed round logic using behn.~~
    3. Gathering of incoming requests in the
     beginning of round, then simultaneous processing.
    4. Client-side logic for resending unread
  messages.
3. Chain of servers (no permutations).
4. Permutations.
5. Noise messages.
6. Make packets same size.
...
X. Make graphical interface on React.
