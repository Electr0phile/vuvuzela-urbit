# vuvuzela-urbit
[Vuvuzela messenger](https://github.com/vuvuzela/vuvuzela) implementation on [Urbit](https://urbit.org/).

This is my first attempt in programming on Urbit, so for now it is kind of a mess :)

Plan:

0. ~~Ships can exchange end-to-end encrypted messages
through one server.~~
1. ~~Dead drop logic with just one server.~~
2. ~~Round logic with just one server.~~
3. Chain of servers (no permutations).
    1. ~~End-server logic.~~
        * Reevaluate style, reformat to conventions.
    2. Middle-server logic.
4. Permutations.
5. Timed rounds using Behn.
6. Actual encryption logic, not dummy.
7. Noise messages.
8. Make packets same size.

...

X. Make graphical interface on React.
XX. Think through high-level chain formation logic (e. g. change server list, handle unreliable servers).
