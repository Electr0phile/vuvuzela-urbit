- List processing in the vuvuzela-end-server.hoon is horrible
  and deserves to be printed out and burned. Need to be redone.

- Three different apps for three different types of servers is
  ugly, need to unify in one file/app.

- Functions that don't change state, like all functions on the
  end server don't need =^ wrapping.

- Utilize wire ordering property, finally.
