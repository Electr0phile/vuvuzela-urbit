Relevant particularities of Urbit in relation to Vuvuzela:
- Every user knows every other user's public key
  by default. Thus we don't need to set up PKI.
- All networking packets are end-to-end encrypted.
  However, our threat models include situations
  where all but one servers are compromized. Thus
  we still have to perform onion encryption.
- States are versioned, no information is ever lost,
  everything stays in history. Bad for long-term
  correlation surveillance?
- All messages on one wire are always received in
  the same order they were sent. We can use that to
  increase the number of simultaneous conversations.

Important points:
- For now, each round you cand send one message and
  receive one message.
