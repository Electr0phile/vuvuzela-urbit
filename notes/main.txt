Relevant particularities of Urbit in relation to Vuvuzela:
- Every user knows every other user's public key
  by default. Thus we don't need to set up PKI.
- All networking packets are end-to-end encrypted.
  However, our threat models include situations
  where all but one servers are compromized. Thus
  we still have to perform onion encryption.
- states are versioned, no information is ever lost,
  everything stays in history. Bad for correlation
  attacks?

Important points:
- Each round you cand send one message and receive
  one message.

Current implementation specifics:
- Checking for empty dead drop yields no response
  from the server.
- Server can switch between manual and automatic
  round rotation. This is only temporary, an actual
  server in the future will be unable to stop round
  rotation.
