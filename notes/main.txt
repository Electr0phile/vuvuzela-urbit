Relevant particularities of Urbit in relation to Vuvuzela:
- Every user knows every other user's public key
  by default. Thus we don't need to set up PKI.
- All networking packets are end-to-end encrypted.
  However, our threat models include situations
  where all but one servers are compromized. Thus
  we still have to perform onion encryption.
